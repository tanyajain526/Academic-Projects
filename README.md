**This project stemmed from the exploration of a hospital patients dataset with the aim of extracting meaningful insights and providing actionable recommendations for hospital management. Leveraging various data analysis techniques, we uncovered valuable patterns and trends within the data, shedding light on factors influencing patient outcomes. Furthermore, by implementing machine learning algorithms, we were able to predict patient survival rates with a commendable accuracy of 80%.
Hospital-Patients Data Set**
 
The ‘hospital.csv’ data set, (91713 rows and 85 columns)
 
Each row in this dataset represents a single patient's information during their stay in a healthcare unit. Each row provides a collection of data points (values) for that specific patient, and these data points are organized into columns as described in the column descriptions provided earlier.
For example, the first row contains information about a specific patient, including their unique encounter ID, patient ID, hospital ID, age, BMI, elective surgery status, ethnicity, gender, height, ICU admission source, ICU ID, ICU stay type, ICU type, pre-ICU length of stay, weight, diagnosis codes, clinical measurements, comorbidity indicators, and other relevant information.
Each subsequent row in the dataset represents data for another patient's stay in the healthcare unit, with values for each of the 85 columns providing details about that specific patient's characteristics, clinical parameters, and diagnosis.
